--These are preliminary for-comprehension tests
-- The following assumptions have been made:
--  1. It is possible to loop over empty structures
--     which either does nothing,
--     or returns a new struct that is empty.
--  2. It is possible to loop over different kinds of structures
--     If using for as a function call, it will return
--     a similar struct as the first one listed, but perhaps
--     containing elements of different type.
--  3. Looping over multiple structures is done in a nested may:
--        for x <- [1, 2], y <- [3, 4]
--     would loop over all the y elements for every x element
--  4. Mutable variables can be changed inside a for-loop
--  5. To use for over a structure, it must only allow one type of element
--     i.e. be homogenous, thus for example, it cannot iterate over a tuple
--  6. The following tests assume there is a simple Container LinkedList which
--     has support for map and flatMap.

--None of these examples should compile at all

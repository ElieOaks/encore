This directory contains all the examples from the main paper.
Since Encore is an object oriented language while LOLCAT is
presented in a procedural language, we provide both "procedural"
versions that resemble the language from the paper (see proc), as
well as "object oriented" versions that are written in a style
more suitable for Encore (see oo). The examples are:

* Treiber Stack (Stack.enc)

* Michael-Scott Queue (Queue.enc)

* Tim Harris' List (List.enc)

The Makefile can build all the examples (make all) as well as run
them (make run).
